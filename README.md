# Project_1

The Network Packet Tracer is a Python-based tool built using Scapy for network traffic analysis. It is designed to capture and analyze packets in real time, providing users with insights into network activity. The tool also includes a basic Graphical User Interface (GUI) for ease of use and accessibility.

This project is perfect for students, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and professionals looking to understand and analyze network traffic, identify potential vulnerabilities, and simulate packet tracing scenarios.

 Features:
- **Packet Capture:** Capture live network packets for analysis.
- **Packet Filtering:** Filter packets based on protocols such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
- **Detailed Insights:** Extract key information, including source/destination IP, ports, and protocols.
- **GUI Support:** Interactive interface for ease of use, built using **Tkinter**.
- **Export Logs:** Save packet data to a file for further analysis.

Tools and Libraries:
Dependencies:
- **Python**: Version 3.6+
- **Scapy**: For capturing and dissecting network packets.
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface.
